# My Government Online Wiki #

This is the code for My Government Online wiki. It contains the WordPress theme and template files that the app uses and that code that makes the contact portion of the app.

The four template files that requires the custom PHP code in core/includes:

* Jurisdiction_contact_info.php
* My_government_online_contact_info.php
* Select_issue.php
* Select_state-jurisdiction.php

To use custom PHP in WordPress Iâ€™ve used a little trick by making these four pages template files that have been named and described accordingly.

For example, I would create a WordPress page called Select Issue then for that page I would just leave it blank and select the template (Custom PHP) Select Issue in the right hand corner and then publish the page and all my custom PHP will appear in that page.
